# ✅ Groq API Key Setup Complete

## Configuration Status

✅ **Groq API Key Added**: `<your_groq_api_key_here>`
✅ **Location**: `python-scrapper/.env` (line 11)

## What's Now Enabled

With Groq configured, all your LLM features will work:

### 1. **Niche Classification** 🎯
- Automatically categorizes business niches
- Example: "orthopedic doctor" → "doctor" category
- Stores in `job.meta['canonical_niche']`

### 2. **Segment Naming** 🏷️
- AI-generated names for lead clusters
- Example: "Premium Dental Practices in Manhattan"
- Makes segments more meaningful

### 3. **Insights Generation** 💡
- Market analysis and patterns
- Outreach suggestions
- Business opportunities

### 4. **Custom Field Extraction** 📊
- Extract structured data from websites using LLM

## Next Steps

1. **Install Groq package** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install groq
   ```

2. **Restart your backend**:
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C if running)
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Create a new job** in the frontend

4. **Verify it's working**:
   - Check logs for successful LLM calls
   - No more "LLM call failed" warnings
   - Niche classification appears in job metadata
   - Segments have AI-generated names
   - Insights are generated

## Expected Log Output

When creating a job, you should see:
```
INFO:app.services.niche_classifier:Classified niche: dentist
INFO:app.services.segmentation_service:Created 4 segments for job X
INFO:app.services.insights_service:Generated insights for job X
```

Instead of:
```
WARNING:app.services.niche_classifier:LLM niche classification failed: asyncio.run() cannot be called...
```

# ✅ Groq API Key Configured!

Your Groq API key has been set up for AI-powered lead enrichment.

## 🎯 What's Configured

- ✅ Groq API key added to `.env` file
- ✅ Groq client implementation added
- ✅ Auto-detection from environment variables
- ✅ Ready to use for AI extraction and enrichment

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Groq Library

```bash
pip install groq
```

### 2. Verify Setup

```python
from app.ai.factory import create_llm_client

# This will automatically use your Groq API key from .env
client = create_llm_client()
if client:
    print("✅ Groq client ready!")
else:
    print("❌ Check your .env file")
```

### 3. Use in Scraping

When you run scraping jobs, AI enrichment happens automatically:

```python
from app.workers.scraper_tasks import scrape_job_task

# AI enrichment will use Groq automatically
await scrape_job_task(job_id=123, enable_ai=True)
```

## 📋 What Groq Does

1. **Extracts structured data** from messy HTML:
   - Emails, phones, addresses
   - Services, languages, social links
   - Business information

2. **Calculates quality scores** (0-100)

3. **Generates tags** for filtering

4. **Creates outreach notes** for personalization

## 🔧 API Key Location

Your API key is stored in: `.env`

```
GROQ_API_KEY=<your_groq_api_key_here>
```

## ⚠️ Security Note

- `.env` is in `.gitignore` (won't be committed)
- Never share your API key
- Keep it secure

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Start scraping - AI will automatically enrich leads
3. Check results - leads will have quality scores and tags

# Groq API Key Configuration

## ✅ Key Added

Your Groq API key has been added to `.env`:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=<your_groq_api_key_here>
```

## What This Enables

Now that Groq is configured, all LLM features will work:

1. **Niche Classification** 
   - Automatically categorizes business niches (e.g., "dentist" → canonical category)
   - Stores in `job.meta['canonical_niche']`

2. **Segment Naming**
   - AI-generated names for lead clusters
   - Example: "Premium Dental Practices in Manhattan"

3. **Insights Generation**
   - Market analysis and patterns
   - Outreach suggestions
   - Business opportunities

4. **Custom Field Extraction**
   - Extract structured data from websites using LLM

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your backend** (if it's running):
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Create a new job** in the frontend

3. **Check the results**:
   - No more "LLM call failed" warnings
   - Niche classification working
   - Segments with AI-generated names
   - Insights generated

## How It Works

The system automatically detects and uses Groq if `GROQ_API_KEY` is set. Priority order:
1. Groq (if `GROQ_API_KEY` is set) ← **You're using this now**
2. OpenAI (if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set)
3. Anthropic (if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set)

- 🆓 **Free tier** - Generous rate limits
- 🎯 **Good quality** - Uses Llama 3.1 models
